URLs were
never intended to be what they’ve become: an arcane
way for a user to identify a site on the Web. 
Unfortunately, we’ve never been able to standardize
URNs, which would give us a more useful naming system. 
Arguing that the current URL system is sufficient
is like praising the DOS command line, and stating
that most people should simply learn to use command
line syntax.  The reason we have windowing systems
is to make computers easier to use, and more widely
used.  The same thinking should lead us to a superior
way of locating specific sites on the Web.<br/></p>

<p>There are several different ways to understand the ‘Internet’.  One is as a
system of computers connected using a computer network.  That version of the
Internet came into being in 1969 with the creation of the ARPANET.  Mail, files
and chat all moved over that network before the creation of HTTP, HTML, or the
‘web browser’.</p>
<p>In 1992 Tim Berners-Lee created three things, giving birth to what <em>we</em>
consider the Internet. The HTTP protocol, HTML, and the URL.  His goal was to
bring ‘Hypertext’ to life.  Hypertext at its simplest is the ability to
create documents which link to one another.  At the time it was viewed more as a
science fiction panacea, to be complimented by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">Hypermedia</a>, and any other word you
could add ‘Hyper’ in front of.</p>
<p>The key requirement of Hypertext was the ability to link from one document to
another.  In TBL’s time though, these documents were hosted in a multitude of
formats and accessed through protocols like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> and FTP.  He needed a
consistent way to refer to a file which encoded its protocol, its host on the
Internet, and where it existed on that host.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.w3.org/Conferences/IETF92/WWX_BOF_mins.html">the original</a>
World-Wide Web presentation in March of 1992 TBL described it as a ‘Universal
Document Identifier’ (UDI).  Many <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/old/osi-ds-29-00.txt">different
formats</a> were considered for
this identifier:</p>
<pre><code>protocol: aftp host: xxx.yyy.edu path: /pub/doc/README
PR=aftp; H=xx.yy.edu; PA=/pub/doc/README;
PR:aftp/xx.yy.edu/pub/doc/README
/aftp/xx.yy.edu/pub/doc/README)
</code></pre><p>This document also explains why spaces must be encoded in URLs (%20):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of white space characters has been avoided  in UDIs: spaces
are not legal characters.   This was done because of the frequent
introduction of extraneous white space when lines are wrapped by
systems such as mail, or sheer necessity of narrow column width, and
because of the  inter-conversion of various forms of white space
which occurs during character code conversion and the transfer of
text between applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s most important to understand is that the URL was fundamentally just an
abbreviated way of refering to the combination of scheme, domain, port,
credentials and path which previously had to be understood contextually for
each different communication system.</p>
<p>It was first
officially defined in an <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC</a> published in 1994.</p>
<pre><code>scheme:[//[user:<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e494859797938b9680a4">[email&#160;protected]</a>]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]
</code></pre><p>This system made it possible to refer to different systems from within
Hypertext, but now that virtually all content is hosted over HTTP, may not be
as necessary anymore.  As early as
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1996JanFeb/0075.html">1996</a>
browsers were already inserting the <code>http://</code> and <code>www.</code> for users
automatically (rendering any advertisement which still contains them truly
ridiculous).</p>
<h3 id="path">Path</h3>

<p>
I do not think the question is whether people can learn the meaning of the URL,
I just find it it morally abhorrent to force grandma or grandpa to understand
what, in the end, are UNIX file system conventions.  </p>

<p>The slash separated path component of a URL should be familiar to any user of
any computer built in the last fifty years.  The hierarchal filesystem itself
was introduced by the <a href="http://www.multicians.org/">MULTICS</a> system.  Its
creator, in turn, attributes it to <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/">a two hour conversation with Albert
Einstein</a> he had in 1952.</p>
<p>MULTICS used the greater than symbol (<code>&gt;</code>) to separated file path components.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;usr&gt;bin&gt;local&gt;awk
</code></pre><p>That was perfectly logical, but unfortunately the Unix folks
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.html">decided</a> to use <code>&gt;</code> to
represent redirection, delegating path separation to the forward slash (<code>/</code>). </p>

<p><a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9282809&amp;fileId=S1472669614000255">One
half</a>
of the URLs referenced by US Supreme Court opinions point to pages which no
longer exist.  If you were reading an academic paper in 2011, written in 2001,
you have better than even odds that any given URL won’t
<a href="http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-S14-S5">be valid</a>.</p>
<p>There was <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0234.html">a fervent
belief</a> in 1993
that the URL would die, in favor of the ‘URN’.  The Uniform Resource Name is a
permanent reference to a given piece of content which, unlike a URL, will never
change or break.  Tim Berners-Lee first described the “urgent need” for them as
early as <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1991/0018.html">1991</a>.</p>
<p>The simplest way to craft a URN might be to simply use a cryptographic hash of
the contents of the page, for example: <code>urn:791f0de3cfffc6ec7a0aacda2b147839</code>.
This method doesn’t meet the criteria of the web community though, as it wasn’t
really possible to figure out who to ask to turn that hash into a piece of real
content.  It also didn’t account for the format changes which often happen to
files (compressed vs uncompressed for example) which nevertheless represent the
same content.</p>

URLs"/></p>
<p>In 1996 Keith Shafer and several others proposed a solution to the problem
of broken URLs.  <a href="http://purl.oclc.org/OCLC/PURL/INET96">The
link</a> to this solution is now broken.
Roy Fielding posted an implementation suggestion in July of 1995.  <a href="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/draft-ietf-uri-roy-urn-urc-00.txt">The
link</a> is
now broken.</p>
<p>I was able to find these pages through Google, which has functionally
made page titles the URN of today.  The URN format was ultimately finalized in
1997, and has essentially never been used since.  The implementation is itself
interesting.  Each URN is composed of two components, an <code>authority</code> who can
resolve a given type of URN, and the specific ID of this document in whichever
format the <code>authority</code> understands.  For example, <code>urn:isbn:0131103628</code> will
identify a book, forming a permanent link which can (hopefully) be turned into
a set of URLs by your local <code>isbn</code> resolver.</p>
<p>Given the power of search engines, it’s possible the best URN format today
would be a simple way for files to point to their former URLs.  We could allow
the search engines to index this information, and link us as appropriate:</p>

<p>If you’ve used the web for any period of time, you are familiar with query
parameters.  They follow the path portion of the URL, and encode options like
<code>?name=zack&amp;state=mi</code>.  It may seem odd to you that queries use the ampersand
character (<code>&amp;</code>) which is the same character used in HTML to encode special
characters.  In fact, if you’ve used HTML for any period of time, you likely
have had to encode ampersands in URLs, turning <code>http://host/?x=1&amp;y=2</code> into
<code>http://host/?x=1&amp;amp;y=2</code> or <code>http://host?x=1&amp;#38;y=2</code> (that particular
confusion has <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0447.html">always
existed</a>).</p>
<p>You may have also noticed that cookies follow a similar, but different format:
<code>x=1;y=2</code> which doesn’t actually conflict with HTML character encoding at all.
This idea was not lost on the W3C, who encouraged implementers to support <code>;</code>
as well as <code>&amp;</code> in query parameters as early as
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866#section-8.2.1">1995</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, this section of the URL was strictly used for searching ‘indexes’.
The Web was originally created (and its funding was based on it creating) a
method of collaboration for high energy physicists.  This is not to say Tim
Berners-Lee didn’t know he was really creating a general-purpose communication
tool.  He <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0286.html">didn’t add
support</a> for
tables for years, which is probably something physicists would have needed.</p>
<p>In any case, these ‘physicists’ needed a way of encoding and linking to
information, and a way of searching that information.  To provide that, Tim
Berners-Lee created the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/isindex"><code>&lt;ISINDEX&gt;</code></a>
tag.  If <code>&lt;ISINDEX&gt;</code> appeared on a page, it would inform the browser that this
is a page which can be searched.  The browser should show a search field, and
allow the user to send a query to the server.</p>
<p>That
<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Search.html">query</a>
was formatted as keywords separated by plus characters (<code>+</code>):</p>
<pre><code>http://cernvm/FIND/?sgml+cms
</code></pre><p>In fantastic Internet fashion, this tag was quickly abused to do all manner of
things including providing an input to calculate square roots.  It was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0042.html">quickly
proposed</a>
that perhaps this was too specific, and we really needed a general purpose
<code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>That particular proposal actually uses plus signs to separate the components of
what otherwise looks like a modern GET query:</p>
<pre><code>http://somehost.somewhere/some/path?x=xxxx+y=yyyy+z=zzzz
</code></pre><p>This was far from universally acclaimed.  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0032.html">Some
believed</a>
we needed a way of saying that the content on the other side of links should be searchable:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;a HREF=&#34;wais://quake.think.com/INFO&#34; INDEX=1&gt;search&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0044.html">thought</a>
we should have a way of defining strongly-typed queries:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;ISINDEX TYPE=&#34;iana:/www/classes/query/personalinfo&#34;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I can be somewhat confident in saying, in retrospect, I am glad the more
generic solution won out.</p>
<p>The real work on <code>&lt;INPUT&gt;</code>
<a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0079.html">began</a> in
January of 1993 based on an older SGML type.  It was (perhaps unfortunately),
<a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0085.html">decided</a> that
<code>&lt;SELECT&gt;</code> inputs needed a separate, richer, structure:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;select name=FIELDNAME type=CHOICETYPE [value=VALUE] [help=HELPUDI]&gt;
&lt;choice&gt;item 1
&lt;choice&gt;item 2
&lt;choice&gt;item 3
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re curious, reusing <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, rather than introducing the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>
element was
<a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0188.html">absolutely</a>
considered.  There were, of course, alternative form proposals.
<a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0168.html">One</a> included
some variable substituion evocative of what Angular might do today:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;ENTRYBLANK TYPE=int LENGTH=length DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&gt;
Prompt &lt;/ENTRYBLANK&gt;
&lt;QUESTION TYPE=float DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&gt; Prompt &lt;/QUESTION&gt;
&lt;CHOICE DEFAULT=default VAR=lval&gt;
&lt;ALTERNATIVE VAL=value1&gt; Prompt1
...
&lt;ALTERNATIVE VAL=valuen&gt; Promptn
&lt;/CHOICE&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example the inputs are checked against the type specified in <code>type</code>,
and the <code>VAR</code> values are available on the page for use in <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0150.html">string
substitution</a>
in URLs, à la:</p>
<pre><code>http://eager.io/apps/$appId
</code></pre><p>Additional
<a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0188.html">proposals</a>
actually used <code>@</code>, rather than <code>=</code>, to separate query components:</p>
<pre><code><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cfa1aea2aa8fb9aea3baaa">[email&#160;protected]</a><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ae85c0cfc3cbee">[email&#160;protected]</a>(value&amp;value)
</code></pre><p>It was Marc Andreessen who
<a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0812.html">suggested</a> our
current method based on what he had already implemented in Mosaic:</p>
<pre><code>name=value&amp;name=value&amp;name=value
</code></pre><p>Just <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0437.html">two months
later</a> Mosaic
would add support for <code>method=POST</code> forms, and ‘modern’ HTML forms were born.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also Marc Andreessen’s company
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990421025406/http://home.mcom.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">Netscape</a>
who would create the cookie format (using a different separator).  Their
proposal was itself painfully shortsighted, led to the attempt to introduce a
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt"><code>Set-Cookie2</code></a> header, and introduced
fundamental structural issues we still deal with at Eager to this day.</p>
<h3 id="fragments">Fragments</h3>
<p>The portion of the URL following the ‘#’ is known as the fragment.  Fragments
were a part of URLs since their <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">initial
specification</a>,
used to link to a specific location on the page being loaded.  For example, if
I have an anchor on my site:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;a name=&#34;bio&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I can link to it:</p>
<pre><code>http://zack.is/#bio
</code></pre><p>This concept was gradually extended to any element (rather than just anchors),
and moved to the <code>id</code> attribute rather than <code>name</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;h1 id=&#34;bio&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee decided to use this character based on its connection to
addresses in the United States (despite the fact that he’s British by birth).
In <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#etc">his words</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a snail mail address in the US at least, it is common to use the number sign
for an apartment number or suite number within a building.
So 12 Acacia Av #12 means “The building at 12 Acacia Av, and then within that
the unit known numbered 12”. It seemed to be a natural character for the task.
Now, <a href="http://www.example.com/foo#bar">http://www.example.com/foo#bar</a> means “Within resource
<a href="http://www.example.com/foo">http://www.example.com/foo</a>, the particular view of it known as bar”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)">original Hypertext system</a>,
created by Douglas Englebart, also used the ‘#’ character for the same purpose.
This may be coincidental or it could be a case of accidental “idea borrowing”.</p>
<p>Fragments are explicitly not included in HTTP requests, meaning they only live
inside the browser.  This concept proved very valuable when it came time to
implement client-side navigation (before
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">pushState</a> was
introduced). Fragments were also very valuable when it came time to think about
how we can store state in URLs without actually sending it to the server.  What
could that mean? Let’s explore:</p>
<h3 id="molehills-and-mountains">Molehills and Mountains</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is a whole standard, as yukky as SGML, on Electronic data 
Intercahnge [sic], meaning forms and form submission. I know no more
except it looks like fortran backwards with no spaces.
</p>
<p>
— Tim Berners-Lee <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0091.html"><code>1993</code></a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a popular perception that the internet standards bodies didn’t do much
from the finalization of HTTP 1.1 and HTML 4.01 in 2002 to when HTML 5 really
got on track.  This period is also known (only by me) as the Dark Age of XHTML.
The truth is though, the standardization folks were <em>fantastically busy</em>.  They
were just doing things which ultimately didn’t prove all that valuable.</p>
<p>One such effort was the Semantic Web.  The dream was to create a Resource
Description Framework (editorial note: run away from any team which seeks to
create a framework), which would allow metadata about content to be universally
expressed.  For example, rather than creating a nice web page about my Corvette
Stingray, I could make an RDF document describing its size, color, and the
number of speeding tickets I had gotten while driving it.</p>
<p>This is, of course, in no way a bad idea.  But the format was XML based, and
there was a big chicken-and-egg problem between having the entire world
documented, and having the browsers do anything useful with that documentation.</p>
<p>It did however provide a powerful environment for philosophical argument.  One
of the best such arguments lasted at least ten years, and was known by the
masterful codename
‘<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#httpRange-14">httpRange-14</a>’.</p>
<p>httpRange-14 sought to answer the fundamental question of what a URL is.  Does
a URL always refer to a document, or can it refer to anything? Can I have a URL
which points to my car?</p>
<p>They didn’t attempt to answer that question in any satisfying manner.  Instead
they focused on how and when we can use 303 redirects to point users from links
which aren’t documents to ones which are, and when we can use URL fragments
(the bit after the ‘#’) to <a href="http://blog.iandavis.com/2010/11/a-guide-to-publishing-linked-data-without-redirects/">point users to linked
data</a>.</p>
<p>To the pragmatic mind of today, this might seem like a silly question.  To many
of us, you can use a URL for whatever you manage to use it for, and people will
use your thing or they won’t.  But the Semantic Web cares for nothing more than
semantics, so it was on.</p>
<p>This particular topic was discussed on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/01-tag-summary#arch-doc">July 1st
2002</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/15-tag-summary#L3330">July 15th
2002</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/22-tag-summary#L3974">July 22nd
2002</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/29-tag-summary#httpRange-14">July 29th
2002</a>, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Sep/0127">September 16th
2002</a>, and at least
20 other occasions through 2005.  It was resolved by the great ‘<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html">httpRange-14
resolution</a>’ of
2005, then reopened by complaints in
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2007Jul/0034.html">2007</a> and
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-awwsw/2011Jan/0021.html">2011</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/uddp/change-proposal-call.html">a call for new
solutions</a> in 2012.
The question was heavily discussed by the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/pedantic-web/httprange-14/pedantic-web/iLY6VFvN-H0/SXQwc-lOpM8J">pedantic
web</a>
group, which is very aptly named.  The one thing which didn’t happen is all
that much semantic data getting put on the web behind any sort of URL.</p>
<h3 id="auth">Auth</h3>
<p>As you may know, you can include a username and password in URLs:</p>
<pre><code>http://zack:<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="691a0101010101012913080a0247001a">[email&#160;protected]</a>
</code></pre><p>The browser then encodes this authentication data into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>, and sends it as a header:</p>
<pre><code>Authentication: Basic emFjazpzaGhoaGho
</code></pre><p>The only reason for the Base64 encoding is to allow characters which might not
be valid in a header, it provides no obscurity to the username and password
values.</p>
<p>Particularily over the pre-SSL internet, this was very problematic.  Anyone who
could snoop on your connection could easily see your password.  <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0297.html">Many
alternatives</a>
were proposed including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)">Kerberos</a> which is a widely
used security protocol both then and now.</p>
<p>As with so many of these examples though, the simple <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q3/0882.html">basic auth
proposal</a> was
easiest for browser manufacturers (Mosaic) to implement.  This made it the
first, and ultimately the only, solution until developers were given the tools
to build their own authentication systems.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-application">The Web Application</h3>
<p>In the world of web applications, it can be a little odd to think of the basis
for the web being the hyperlink.  It is a method of linking one document to another,
which was gradually augmented with styling, code execution, sessions,
authentication, and ultimately became the social shared computing experience so
many 70s researchers were trying (and failing) to create.  Ultimately, the
conclusion is just as true for any project or startup today as it was then: all
that matters is adoption.  If you can get people to use it, however slipshod it
might be, they will help you craft it into what they need.  The corollary is,
of course, no one is using it, it doesn’t matter how technically sound it might
be.  There are countless tools which millions of hours of work went into which
precisely no one uses today.</p>
